Dear \[PERSON\],

I am writing to express my strong interest in \[POSITION\] at \[COMPANY\]. With nearly 5 years of experience in delivering robust testing solutions and a core belief in fostering a culture of built-in quality, I am confident I possess the skills and mindset to make a significant contribution to your team.

My approach to quality assurance is driven by two core principles: putting the user first and embedding quality throughout the entire development lifecycle. I believe quality is a shared responsibility, not a final gate. At my current role, I translated this philosophy into action by developing a robust e2e automation suite with Playwright and TypeScript. This initiative provided developers with rapid feedback, enabling them to merge code with higher confidence and directly supporting deployment frequency. By coaching the team on quality practices and designing robust SQL validation strategies, I helped prevent critical issues from reaching production.

I was immediately drawn to this position as it offers the opportunity to \[MENTION SOMETHING FROM THE JOB DESCRIPTION\] using \[MENTION A KEY TECHNOLOGY\]. My experience in \[MENTION MY RELEVENT SKILL\] aligns directly with this.  
\[OR\]  
Having learned about \[Company Name\]'s mission to \[state their mission from the 'About Us' page\], I was compelled to apply. I am passionate about using my skills to support products that \[mention the benefit to their customers\].

I am always looking for ways to enhance efficiency and embrace emerging technologies to accelerate delivery, including integrating AI-powered tools into my workflow. My CV provides further detail on my technical qualifications, and I am very keen to discuss how my hands-on skills and strategic approach to quality assurance can benefit \[COMPANY\].

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Vitalii Khymynets
