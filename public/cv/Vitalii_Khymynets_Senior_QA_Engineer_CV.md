**Professional Experience**

QA Engineer | Awesome Technology, London | January 2021 \- Present

* Led the quality strategy for a new platform in a fast-paced, agile environment, successfully balancing rapid time-to-market with evolving quality standards. By championing a 'built-in quality' culture and promoting cross-functional collaboration through paired testing sessions, I equipped engineers with the skills to test their own code effectively, which reduced the traditional QA bottleneck and enabled confident, continuous deployments to production.  
* To accelerate feature delivery for a new service, I designed and launched an e2e automation framework using Playwright and TypeScript. By implementing the Page Object Model, I created a scalable and easy-to-maintain test suite that provided rapid feedback on new builds, empowering developers to merge code with higher confidence and directly supporting a faster time-to-market.  
* To mitigate the risks associated with a complex data migration, I designed and executed a multi-layered validation strategy that combined SQL test queries, targeted automation for result verification and reporting, and manual exploratory testing. This proactive approach ensured a high level of confidence in data integrity, driving a seamless and on-time deployment.  
* To enhance the team's data validation capabilities, I designed and delivered a series of SQL workshops for the QA team. This initiative helped to upskill 4 team members, fostering a more proactive and efficient testing process and embedding a culture of continuous learning and improvement.  
* Actively participated in Agile ceremonies, including sprint planning, retrospectives, and daily stand-ups, providing quality-focused input on story refinement, acceptance criteria definition, and risk assessment to ensure cross-functional alignment and shared ownership of quality across the development lifecycle.
